## 🚀 How to Run the Project

Please follow these steps:

### 1. Install dependencies

Open your terminal inside the project folder and run: npm install


This will install all required packages listed in `package.json`.

### 2. Create `.env` file

The `.env` file is required to define environment variables like `PORT`, `MONGO_URI`, and `JWT_SECRET`.

This file was sent privately to the instructor and should be placed in the root directory of the project.

### 3. Run the server

#### For production: npm start


#### For development (with auto-restart):
Make sure `nodemon` is installed: npm install --save-dev nodemon ,npm run dev
